# Rat-in-a-Maze
This program solves the "Rat in a Maze" problem using backtracking. Given a maze represented as a 2D matrix, the rat starts from the top-left corner (0, 0) and has to reach the bottom-right corner (n-1, n-1). The rat can only move down or right, and it can only move through cells marked as 1 in the maze.
